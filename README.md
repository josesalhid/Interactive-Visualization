# Economic Inactivity Visualization

This project is an interactive D3.js-based visualization that explores different aspects of economic inactivity in the UK. It allows users to explore trends in employment preference, job-seeking behavior, and reasons for not seeking work.

Each dataset can be selected from a dropdown menu, and the graph updates dynamically to reflect the chosen topic.
